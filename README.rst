``skeleton`` is a responsive, minimal theme for the `Nikola`_ static site
generator based on the `Skeleton`_ web framework.

The theme is incredibly lightweight, coming in at ~220KB, including fonts.

Most (all?) Nikola features are supported.

A navbar, with dropdown submenus is included out of the box. On small devices,
the navmenu will be replaced by a dropbox containing the same options.
