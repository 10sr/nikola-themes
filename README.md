This repo contains the publicly available themes for Nikola (https://getnikola.com/)

To contribute a theme:

* Start a branch that puts your theme "foo" in vX/foo
* Run ``scripts/test_themes.py foo`` and see if it complains of anything
* Run ``scripts/build_themes.py foo`` and see if it works correctly (output is in output/vX/foo)
* Make sure you have a README (in markdown) in your theme
* Double check licenses for everyhing in your theme
* Do a PR

After a brief discussion it will be merged and available for everyone :-)
